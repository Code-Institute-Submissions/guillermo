Accompanied by an essay from musicologist Nigel Simeone, Guillermo performs this selection on two instruments by instrument builder Titus Crijnen - copies of instruments by G.B. Giusti (1681) and H. Ruckers (1624) with grand ravalement (1680).",

The aim of the ensemble is to recreate repertoire from the early seicento until the late Baroque searching and exploring the extravagance that flourished when composers and instrumentalists dared to traverse the established limits of the usual. Fantasticus prides itself on the fact that it makes no compromises with regard to authentic performance, fearlessly trespassing on the borders of correctness.",
